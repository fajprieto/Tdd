Pascal Mock
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pascalmock/

*** How to use ***

Look at the file tests\PascalMockExampleTest.pas for usage examples.

*** Third Party ***

In order to compile the tests project, you need the DUnit library:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/dunit/

However you can use Pascal Mock without DUnit or with another testing framework.

*** Optional ***

You can use FastMM for memory leak reporting:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastmm/

To do this make the following changes in PascalMockTestPrj.dpr:

change:

uses
//  FastMM4,
  Forms,
  ...

to:

uses
  FastMM4,
  Forms,
  ...
